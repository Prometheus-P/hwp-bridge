# Commercial License (HwpBridge Pro)

This repository is **Apache-2.0** licensed (see `LICENSE`).
That means anyone can use, modify, and redistribute the open-source code — including for commercial purposes.

So where does money come from?

## The rule
- **Core (this repo):** Apache-2.0, free forever.
- **Pro/Enterprise add-ons:** distributed under a **separate commercial license** (not included in this repo).

## What can be “Pro” (examples)
- High-fidelity conversions (HWP → DOCX) with layout fidelity targets + regression tests
- Font mapping / embedded font extraction / image extraction pipelines
- Batch conversion API (rate limits, auth, audit logs)
- Enterprise features: SSO, DLP hooks, watermarking, redaction logs, SLA/support

## When you need a commercial license
You only need it if you want **Pro add-ons** or **paid support/SLA** from the maintainers.
Using the open-source core does **not** require any payment.

## Template terms (replace with your actual contract)
- License scope: Internal use / redistribution / OEM
- Seats or usage-based pricing (documents/month)
- Support tiers: Standard / Priority / On-call
- Warranty / indemnity / liability caps
- Compliance (PII, retention, audit)
